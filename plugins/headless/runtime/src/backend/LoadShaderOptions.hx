 * Options for loading shader resources in the headless backend.
 * 
 * These options would typically control how shader files are loaded,
 * compiled, and processed. In headless mode, these options are
 * maintained for API compatibility but don't affect actual
 * shader loading since no compilation occurs.
 * 
 * Currently, no specific options are defined, but the structure
 * allows for future expansion.
