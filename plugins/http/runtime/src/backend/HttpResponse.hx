/**
 * Low-level HTTP response data structure used by backend implementations.
 * 
 * This class represents the raw response data returned by platform-specific
 * HTTP implementations before any high-level processing. It contains the
 * essential response information that all platforms must provide.
 * 
 * The backend response is used internally by the HTTP plugin and is wrapped
 * by the higher-level ceramic.HttpResponse which provides additional
 * conveniences and processing.
 * 
 * Content handling at the backend level:
 * - Text content is provided via the `content` field
 * - Binary content is provided via the `binaryContent` field
 * - The decision of which field to populate is made by the platform implementation
 *   based on the response's Content-Type header
 * 
 * This class is primarily used by platform-specific backend implementations
 * and should not be used directly by application code.
