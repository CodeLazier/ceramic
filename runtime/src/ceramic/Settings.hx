/**
 * Central configuration hub for Ceramic applications.
 *
 * Settings provides both compile-time and runtime configuration options that control
 * various aspects of your application, from window properties to rendering behavior.
 * Many settings are observable, allowing the app to react to changes dynamically.
 *
 * Settings are typically configured during app initialization but many can be
 * modified at runtime to adjust behavior on the fly.
 *
 * Key configuration areas:
 * - **Display**: Window size, fullscreen, scaling modes
 * - **Performance**: Target FPS, delta time handling
 * - **Rendering**: Background color, antialiasing, shaders
 * - **Assets**: Default assets, asset paths
 * - **Input**: Touch and mouse wheel behavior
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```haxe
 * // Configure display
 * settings.targetWidth = 1280;
 * settings.targetHeight = 720;
 * settings.scaling = FIT;
 *
 * // Set performance options
 * settings.targetFps = 60;
 * settings.maxDelta = 0.1;
 *
 * // Configure rendering
 * settings.background = Color.GRAY;
 * settings.antialiasing = 4;
 * ```
