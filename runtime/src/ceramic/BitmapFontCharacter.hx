/**
 * Represents a single character (glyph) in a bitmap font.
 *
 * This data structure stores all the metrics and texture coordinates needed
 * to correctly render a character from a bitmap font texture atlas. Each
 * character has position data for locating it in the texture, size information,
 * and rendering offsets for proper alignment.
 *
 * The character metrics follow standard font terminology:
 * - Texture coordinates (x, y, width, height) define the glyph's location in the atlas
 * - Offsets (xOffset, yOffset) position the glyph relative to the baseline
 * - Advance (xAdvance) determines cursor movement after rendering
 *
 * ```haxe
 * var charA = font.chars.get(65); // Get letter 'A'
 * var texture = font.pages.get(charA.page);
 *
 * // Render a single character with a quad.
 * // This is just for reference. In practice,
 * // you'd rather use Text class with a bitmap font
 * quad.texture = texture;
 * quad.frameX = charA.x;
 * quad.frameY = charA.y;
 * quad.frameWidth = charA.width;
 * quad.frameHeight = charA.height;
 * quad.pos(cursorX + charA.xOffset, cursorY + charA.yOffset);
 *
 * // Move cursor for next character
 * cursorX += charA.xAdvance;
 * ```
 *
 * @see BitmapFont The font class that contains these characters
 * @see BitmapFontData The complete font data structure
 * @see Text To render text using a bitmap font
