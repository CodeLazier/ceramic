# ceramic-luxe

Ceramic with Luxe backend.

At the moment this is a _luxe_ project (temporary, until we get back a `ceramic` command line tool). You simply need to follow _luxe_ setup guide to be able to run it: https://luxeengine.com/get/

See the short-term roadmap: https://github.com/jeremyfa/ceramic-luxe/issues/1
